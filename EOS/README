This directory contains a basic gamma law equation of state. 
More advanced equation of state routines can be found in our 
Microphysics repository.

gamma_law_general:

   A general gamma-law EOS.  This computes the mean molecular
   weight from the mass fractions and the species properties defined
   in the network module.  

   NOTE: the entropy is currently only correct for a monatomic gas
   (gamma = 5/3).  A more general expression (than the Sackur-Tetrode
   equation) is needed for an arbitrary constant-gamma gas.
