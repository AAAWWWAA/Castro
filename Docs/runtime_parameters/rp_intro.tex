\section{Removed Runtime Parameters}

The following runtime parameters have been removed for \castro.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt castro.ppm\_flatten\_before\_integrals} : this parameter
  controlled whether we applied the flattening of the parabolic
  profiles before we integrated under their profiles or afterwards.
  The default was switched to flattening before the integration,
  which is more consistent with the original PPM methodology.  This
  parameter was removed since the variation enabled by this parameter
  was not that great.
\end{itemize}
