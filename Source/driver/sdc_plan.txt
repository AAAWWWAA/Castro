State Data will hold the old and new solution (as usually)

We'll have a kold vector of MFs, of size m, and a knew vector of MFs,
also size m

kold[0] and knew[0] are both the old time solution, so they will just
be references to the StateData.  The other entries will be at the
intermediate quadrature points in the time integration.

We will use the "new" time solution in the StateData as our work space,
copying knew[m] into it when computing the update for m+1.  This allows
us to fill ghost cells and compute the advective term based on knew[m].

We will also need a vector of m MFs, Aold, to store the advective
terms at the old iteration (kold).  Note: we cannot update these as we
do an update from m to m+1, since the integral in the SDC update
should all be at the same iteration.

None of kold, knew, or Aold need ghost cells.
