mfiter loop:


   1. Fortran routine:

      * convert U_avg to U_cc

   2. calls from C++

      * construct q_bar from U_avg (using ctoprim)
      * construct q_cc from U_cc (using ctoprim)

   3. Fortran routine:

      * construct q_avg from q_bar and q_cc (using ctoprim)

   4. main Fortran routine (accepts construct q_avg)

      * find face-average interface states from q_avg  incl/ flattening
      * solve Riemann problem
      * construct face-centered interface state
      * compute final fluxes
