mfiter loop:


   1. Fortran routine:

      * convert U_avg to U_cc

   2. calls from C++

      * construct q_bar from U_avg (using ctoprim)
      * construct q_cc from U_cc (using ctoprim)

   3. Fortran routine:

      * construct q_avg from q_bar and q_cc (using ctoprim)

   4. in C++, loop over dimensions -- to save memory, we do each separately

      a. main Fortran routine (accepts construct q_avg and q_bar)

         * compute flattening coefficients from q_bar
         * find face-average interface states from q_avg  incl/ flattening
         * solve Riemann problem and return face-averaged interface states

      b. separate MFIter:

         * construct face-centered interface states
         * compute face-centered and face-average fluxes

      c. separate MFIter:
 
         * compute final fluxes


Extra MFs:

  1. q_bar -- needed throughout the entire process
  2. q_int_fc and q_int_avg
  3. F_fc to hold the face-centered fluxes
