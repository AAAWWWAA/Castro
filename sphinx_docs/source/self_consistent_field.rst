Introduction
============

The Hachisu self-consistent field (SCF) method is a way to generate
equilibrium rotating (or non-rotating) initial configurations.
It can generate single or multiple star systems, and can also
generate a torus configuration. (At present we only support
generating a single star.) This SCF method was originally developed
by Hachisu and collaborators :cite:`hachisu:1986a`.
