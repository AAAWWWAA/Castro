New toy problem of a convectively propagate flame, where rotation
keeps it localized.

There are several parameters that affect the dynamics of this problem:

 -- atmosphere

    * rho_base
    * p_base
    * g

 -- reaction rate, simple KPP: H_nuc = A X^n (1 - X^n)

   * n
   * A

 -- rotation:

   * omega



Numbers of interest:

   * Rossby,  Ro ~ U/(L Omega)
   
   * scale height, H ~ p_base / (rho_base g)

   * burning front speed? thickness?
