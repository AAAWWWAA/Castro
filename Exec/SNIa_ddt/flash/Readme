A Simulation Unit is a drop-in component for the FLASH 3.0
hydrodynamics code (flash.uchicago.edu) which configures, initializes
and implements a particular physical problem.

This is a Simulation Unit for performance of Type Ia supernova
simulations with FLASH.  This code is provided as a reference
implementation for the randomized initial condition used by Townsley
etal (2009, ApJ, in press, ArXiv:0906.4384) to construct a framework
for study of SN Ia systematics based on a theoretical population of
SNe Ia.  The critical components for reproducability of the
theoretical population are the random number generator, contained in
the file sim_LCGRandomIterate.F90 and the usage of this for choosing
the coefficients of the multipole initial condition.  The coefficients
are chosen by code in Simulation_init.F90 and their use to generate
the initial flame surface appears in Simulation_initBlock.F90.

Additionally, the implementation of the refinement prescriptions
described in the same paper is included in the files
Grid_markRefineDerefine.F90 and gr_markRefineDerefine.F90.  And an
example initial WD is included in cc_7e8_linear_wd_plain.dat.

Example parameter files for both 1-d and 2-d simulations described in
Townsley etal (2009) are included.  Additional files are relevant to
interaction with the FLASH source tree.
