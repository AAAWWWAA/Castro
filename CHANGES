* changes since the last release:
  
  -- The file sponge_nd.f90 in Source/Src_nd/ has been renamed to
     sponge_nd.F90, the file extension change indicating that it
     can now be run through the preprocessor. Please update your
     local name for this file if you're overriding it in your
     problem setup.

  -- The sponge update is usually done in an implicit fashion,
     but you can now instead do an explicit update with
     castro.sponge_implicit == 0.
